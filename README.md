# Feature Requests
Have a feature in mind? I love to hear about it. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Aezux/Basuzo/issues/new) and let me know.

# Open-Source
Open-source does not mean portable. Basuzo was not built with portability in mind, and a lot of it is dependant on configs, files, and data structures that aren't available on github. The reason it's open-source is so people can look at it's internals and learn how it works; for educational purposes. Hosting it yourself is not supported.
